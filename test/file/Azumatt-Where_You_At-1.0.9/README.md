A server and client side mod to force show position on the map. Can join servers that do not have this mod installed, with this mod installed.

`Install on all clients and the server.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and the config is set to be forced, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

* Lock Configuration [Synced with Server]

1. Locate your main folder manually and :
   1. Extract the contents of the archive into BepInEx\plugins.
